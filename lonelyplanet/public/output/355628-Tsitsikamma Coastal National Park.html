This park (adult/child US$11/6) protects 82km of coast between Plettenberg Bay and Humansdorp, including the area 5km out to sea. Located at the foot of the Tsitsikamma Range and cut by rivers that have carved deep ravines into the ancient forests, it’s a spectacular area to walk through. Several short day walks give you a taste of the coastline. The main information centre for the national park is Storms River Mouth Rest Camp, 68km from Plettenberg Bay and 8km from the N2. The park gate is 6km from the N2. It’s 2km from the gate to the main camp, which is open 24 hours. The 42km Otter Trail (per person US$70) is one of the most acclaimed hikes in South Africa, hugging the coastline from Storms River Mouth to Nature’s Valley. The walk, which lasts five days and four nights, involves fording a number of rivers, and gives access to some superb stretches of coast. Book the trail through SAN Parks (012-426 5111). The trail is usually booked up one year ahead. There are often cancellations, however, so it’s always worth trying. Storms River Mouth Rest Camp (012-428 9111; www.sanparks.org; camp site/forest hut/family cottages US$19/31/99) offers forest huts, chalets, cottages and ‘oceanettes’; all except the forest huts are equipped with kitchens, bedding and bathrooms. Another good option is Tsitsikamma Falls Adventure Park (280 3770; www.tsitsikammaadventure.co.za; Witelsbos; s/d incl breakfast from US$24/49), a family-run guesthouse about halfway between Nature’s Valley and Jeffrey’s Bay, and near a beautiful waterfall. Greyhound, Intercape and Translux buses run along the N2 between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, from where it’s an 8km walk to Storms River Mouth.
